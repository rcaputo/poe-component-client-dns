--------
Abstract
--------

POE::Component::Client::DNS is an asynchronous, event driven wrapper
for Net::DNS's Resolver class.  It accepts events containing
Net::DNS::Resolver questions, and it returns events carrying
Net::DNS::Packet responses.

------------
Requirements
------------

This module requires POE and Net::DNS.  The requirements are encoded
in Makefile.PL.

------------------
Basic Installation
------------------

[Note: This section is written in advance of PoCo::Client::DNS's
placement on the CPAN.  These steps are wrong, and you will find no
joy following them.  Please read the Manual Installation section
instead.]

POE::Component::Client::DNS may be installed through the CPAN shell in
the usual CPAN shell manner.  This typically is:

  $ perl -MCPAN -e 'intstall POE::Component::Client::DNS'

You can also read this README from the CPAN shell:

  $ perl -MCPAN -e shell
  cpan> readme POE::Component::Client::DNS

And you can install the component from the CPAN prompt as well:

  cpan> install POE::Component::Client::DNS

-------------------
Manual Installation
-------------------

POE::Component::Client::DNS can also be installed manually.  The
latest CPAN version can be found at
<ftp://ftp.cpan.org/pub/CPAN/authors/id/R/RC/RCAPUTO/> or in a
similarly named directory at your favorite CPAN mirror.  The most
recent development snapshot, which only rarely contains hideous
show-stopping bugs, is available from POE's web site at
<http://poe.perl.org/>.

Downloading and unpacking the distribution are left as exercises for
the reader.  To build and test it:

  perl Makefile.PL
  make test

The test program, t/01_resolve.t, makes an excellent sample program.
In fact, it was adapted from the sample program used to debug this
component.  If you would like to see more details about the test's
operation, edit t/01_resolve.t and set the DEBUG constant to any value
Perl considers "true".

When you're ready to install the component:

  make install

It should now be ready to use.
