--------
Abstract
--------

POE::Component::Client::DNS is an event driven wrapper for
Net::DNS::Resolver.  It accepts events containing Net::DNS::Resolver
questions, and it emits events carrying Net::DNS::Packet responses.

------------
Requirements
------------

POE::Component::Client::DNS requires a functioning name server.
Transient network problems (or testing the module from a disconnected
machine) may cause it to fail.

This module requires POE and Net::DNS.  Installing it with the CPAN
shell should cause it to do the right thing with regards to these
dependencies.

------------------
Basic Installation
------------------

POE::Component::Client::DNS may be installed through the CPAN shell in
the usual manner.  Typically:

  $ perl -MCPAN -e 'intstall POE::Component::Client::DNS'

You can also read this README from the CPAN shell:

  $ perl -MCPAN -e shell
  cpan> readme POE::Component::Client::DNS

And you can install the component from the CPAN prompt as well:

  cpan> install POE::Component::Client::DNS

-------------------
Manual Installation
-------------------

This module may also be installed manually.  Its distribution is
available from the author's CPAN directory,
<ftp://ftp.cpan.org/pub/CPAN/authors/id/R/RC/RCAPUTO/>, or a similarly
named directory at your favorite CPAN mirror.

Downloading and unpacking the distribution are left as exercises for
the reader.  To build and test it:

  perl Makefile.PL
  make test

The test program, t/01_resolve.t, makes an excellent sample program.
In fact, it was adapted from the sample program used to debug this
component.  If you would like to see more details about the test's
operation, edit t/01_resolve.t and set the DEBUG constant to any value
Perl considers "true".

When you're ready to install the component:

  make install

It should now be ready to use.
